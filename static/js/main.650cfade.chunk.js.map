Yes, just like our home planet, Mars experiences a tilt in its axis, which causes it to experience a spring, summer, fall, and winter because the planet gets different amounts of sunlight on its surface as it orbits the sun. The seasons are roughly twice as long as the ones we have on Earth, but they do still happen! If you spring for a trip to Mars someday, you might just fall in love with the familiarity of the seasons.

Okay, this one is kind of a no-brainer, because Mars has a diameter that is almost 2,000 miles smaller than Earth’s, but the gravity on Mars is considerably weaker than what we feel here on Earth! In fact, it’s about 38% the gravity of Earth. What would that mean for astronauts or future Mars colonists? The weaker gravity would mean that we would have considerably less stress on our muscles and skeletal structures, and over time the bodies of the human visitors would evolve to need those structures less and less.
